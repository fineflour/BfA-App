<h1>The Recovery Version <span class="description">– a unique study bible</span></h1>
<p>The word Bible comes from the Greek word <em>biblos</em>, which means “the book.” This means that the Bible stands as the unique book among all the books in the world. Although it was written by men in human language, it is unique because its nature is divine. The apostle Paul’s word to Timothy tells us that “all Scripture is God-breathed” (2 Tim. 3:16). This indicates that the Scriptures did not come out of man’s thought, man’s mind; rather, God breathed His thought and His word through His Spirit into and out of the writers. Thus, the Bible contains God’s elements and carries His flavor. The greatest blessing and joy in human life is to contact God and taste Him through the words of the Bible (Psa. 119:103).</p>
 <p> As the unique book, the Bible is a book of divine truth. The truths contained in the Bible concern God and His eternal plan, man and his destiny, Christ with His person and work, the Holy Spirit in man’s experience of God, the complete salvation
  of God for man, the church as God’s corporate people, the kingdom of God, and the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</p>

<p>According to the facts of history, after the writing of the Bible was completed, over the succeeding centuries the truths in the Bible gradually became lost or misunderstood. For many years the Bible was even locked away so that the common people could not read it.
  In the sixteenth century, at the time of the Reformation, God began to recover the lost truths of the Bible. In the following centuries, God used a number of His servants to progressively recover the truths in His Word. Those used by God in each generation inherited the truths recovered by their predecessors and went further to receive more light from God through His Word. Eventually, at the end of the twentieth century the recovery of the biblical truths was essentially complete.
The Recovery Version is unique among all of the study Bibles available today. More than being an accurate and readable translation of the biblical text, the Recovery Version contains additional elements that convey the full breadth of the divine truths breathed out by God through the original writers of the Bible and recovered by God’s people over the past five hundred years. The outlines, footnotes, and cross-references in the Recovery Version unveil the divine revelation in the Scriptures and guide the reader into a discovery of the rich treasures hidden below
the surface of the printed pages. Now, in the twenty-first century, the Recovery Version stands out as the Bible for our generation.</p>

<p>The Recovery Version is also unique because it relates all the divine truths in the Bible to one crucial matter—the economy of God. The Bible uses the word economy to describe God’s great enterprise in the universe, which is to dispense Himself into man so that He and man may be one (Eph. 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim. 1:4). God can be likened to a wealthy businessman who has an enormous amount of capital. God has a “business” in this universe, and His vast wealth is simply Himself. Because God has the desire to distribute Himself with all His riches into man, He has a plan, a divine arrangement, a divine economy. This economy is the
central theme of the Bible. The truths of the Bible are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In order to interlock the scattered pieces of a puzzle correctly, we need to be guided by the picture on the box. Likewise, in order to understand the various truths in the Bible in their proper context, we need to look at the “picture on the box” of the Bible, that
is, at the central theme of the Bible unfolded from Genesis to Revelation. Everything God did in the past, is doing in the present, and will do in the future is for the accomplishing of His economy. The revelation of God’s economy puts all
the biblical truths into their proper perspective. The unveiling of the truth in the Bible from the perspective of God’s economy is the foundation of all Christian experience.</p>
<p>It is God’s desire that all men come to the full knowledge of the truth according to His divine economy (1 Tim. 2:4). We sincerely hope that all God’s seekers will benefit from the unveiled truth in the Recovery Version and, even more, that the truth will become their experience as their personal reality.</p>
