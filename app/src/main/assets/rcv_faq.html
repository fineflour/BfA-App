    <h1><a name="about_rcv" id="about_rcv"></a>About the Recovery Version</h1>
    <p class="msg_head">How is the New Testament Recovery Version different from other versions?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">Throughout the centuries, believers have steadily progressed in their discovery and understanding of truths in the Bible. The Recovery Version presents these truths and relates them to the central theme of the Bible—God’s plan to dispense Himself into man. The Recovery Version has insightful study aids such as outlines, footnotes, and cross-references that will help you in your understanding of God’s Word and enrich your Christian experience. BfA chose to distribute it because it is one of the best versions available today.</div>

    <p class="msg_head">Why is it called the Recovery Version?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">Each Bible translation has its own name, for example, “King James Version.” “Recovery Version” is simply the name of this translation. The word recovery does not refer to recovery from alcohol or drug addiction as it is used in the titles of other versions of the Bible. </div>
    <hr><p class="msg_head">What does the word <em>recovery</em> mean?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">The word <em>recovery</em> refers to the regaining of biblical truths, Christian experience, and church practice that have been misunderstood, misinterpreted, misapplied, or missed completely due to the influences of history, tradition, and even religion. Particularly since Martin Luther’s time, God has been progressively recovering these truths, thus affording His people a constantly increasing understanding of the divine revelation. These recovered truths have been brought together in the Recovery Version.</div>
    <hr><p class="msg_head">Who is the publisher of the New Testament Recovery Version?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">Living Stream Ministry in Anaheim, California. The New Testament Recovery Version was first published in 1985 and revised in 1991. The Holy Bible Recovery Version (text only) was published in 1999. The Holy Bible Recovery Version with footnotes, outlines, and cross-references for both the Old and New Testaments, was first published in 2003.</div>
    <hr><p class="msg_head">Is the Old Testament available?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">For the gift offer, Bibles for America chose to give away only the New Testament. The Holy Bible Recovery Version with or without footnotes may be purchased from the publisher, Living Stream Ministry or through a bookstore.</div>
    <hr><p class="msg_head">Who wrote the footnotes?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">Witness Lee wrote the footnotes, based on his more than 50 years study of the Bible and of the best Christian writings throughout the centuries. Extensive information about his life and ministry is available at <a href="#" onclick="launchURL('http://www.witnesslee.org'); return false;">www.witnesslee.org</a>.</div>
    <hr><p class="msg_head">Do you offer the Recovery Version in other languages?</p>
    <div class="msg_body">Although it has been translated into numerous other languages, Bibles for America offers a free copy of the Bible in English and Spanish only. A complimentary copy of the Recovery Version in Chinese (in simplified or traditional characters) is available through the China Gospel Depot (<a href="#" onclick="launchURL('http://www.cgdepot.org'); return false;">www.cgdepot.org</a>).
